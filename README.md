<h3 title="hehehe"> Hi there! ðŸ‘‹</h3>

Welcome to my github page!
<br />
As of now, the only public repositories I have are just shool/military projects, 
<br />
I have some more project like a python network manager including a simple packet sniffer and a gui, A previous streaming service application that I have written in both C and Python, 
<br />
And some more side projects that i'v decided not to upload to github. <br />
I have decided to make all of my other projects private since I wrote them a long time ago, and mostly just to practice new things i have learned such as: <br />
C's basics and socket programming and Select, Python's Scappy and some more technologies, so that the quality of the code is not very high and I dont want that to be my first impression, <br /> since I believe it does not represent my capabilities, but after each failing project time has passed and I have learned a whole lot since about both programming and learning as a skill.
